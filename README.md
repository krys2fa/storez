## Issues
Try searching for your issue on [gitHub](https://github.com/krys2fa/storez/issues) too see if anyone else has posted about a similar issue about the bug you have found too. If someone has, you can upvote the issue by replying to it with "+1" as your message.

If you can't find any relevant issues on GitHub, then create a new issue (see below) and our development team will take a look at your problem.

### Creating a New Issues
Crafting a good issue will make it much easier for the dev team to replicate and resolve your problem. Follow these steps to do it right:

1. Go to our [gitHub Issues](https://github.com/krys2fa/storez/issues) page and click on New Issue.

2. Write a meaningful title that describes the issue. Some good examples are *Logging in from the News and Field Guide pages doesn't redirect properly (using e-mail)* and *Typo: "for" instead of "while" loop*; bad examples include *A bug, HELP!!!!!* and *I found this bug in a Challenge*.

3. Keep the title relatively short, the description is for further information. One example is to shorten long Challenge names, so instead of writing *Test case bug in 'Challenge: Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default'*, you might want to write *Test case bug in 'Radio Buttons' Challenge*.

4. In the body, **provide a link** to the page on which you encountered this issue.
5. Describe the problem and provide steps so that a developer can try to replicate the issue. Include your operating system and browser version.
6. When referencing other issues or pull requests, simply write #issue/pr-number.
7. **Take a screenshot** of the issue and include it in the post.
8. Click **Submit New Issue** and you are done! You will be automatically subscribed to notifications for any updates or future comments.
